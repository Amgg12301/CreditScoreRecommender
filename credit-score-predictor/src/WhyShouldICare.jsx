        <h1>Why should I care about my credit?</h1>
        <div >
          <h3>Q: Does my credit affect my employment options?</h3>
          <div className="answer">
            A: Yes! From the Discover site, "a 2012 study conducted by the Society for Human Resources Management found that 47 percent of employers used credit checks as part of their hiring process."
          </div>
          <h3>Q: Why is having a good credit score important?</h3>
          <div className="answer">
            A: Credit scores are imperative for great long-term financial health. With a high credit score, you have access to better loan and credit card terms and benefits, savings on interest rates, insurance discounts, and much more!
          </div>
          <h3>Q: Why should I start accumulating credit early?</h3>
          <div className="answer">
            A: The earlier you start, the easier it is to have a high credit score ASAP! You won't be spending as much, so it'll be far easier to make on-time payments, and hence you'll have a longer history of on-time payments and responsibility. This also gives you much earlier access to better credit cards and loans with benefits typically unavailable at your age!
          </div>
          <h3>Q: How does my credit score affect my rental and housing options?</h3>
          <div className="answer">
            A: Nearly half of all landlords report that a credit check is in the top three factors when deciding who to rent to, so it has an incredible impact!
          </div>
          <h3>Q: Do student loans help in building my credit?</h3>
          <div className="answer">
            A: Yes, they do! Since student loans are paid off monthly, given that you make those payments on-time monthly, your credit will increase. Paying off debt or rent with your own credit card is a prime example of building credit successfully while in your early years.
          </div>
          <h3>Q: Why is it beneficial to have multiple credit cards?</h3>
          <div className="answer">
            A: A lot of creditors like to see that you can balance a multitude of credit accounts and it helps you in that you can leverage certain rewards from a plethora of credit cards.
          </div>
          <h3>Q: What's my StreetCred in the eyes of creditors and lendors?</h3>
          <div className="answer">
            A: If your credit score is low, they see you as a liability and someone who is more likely to default (failure to pay) on a payment. Therefore. they charge you higher interest rates on credit cards and loans in order to recoup their losses if you were to default, based on your history. Now, this is the complete opposite if you have a great credit score, which is why you should have a great StreetCred and start early!!
          </div>
          <h3>Q: What is the best credit card to begin building credit?</h3>
          <div className="answer">
            A: In StreetCred's opinion, if you are a student, you should apply for the Journey Student Credit Card (https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/journey-student/). If you aren't a student, you should apply for the Secured MasterCard (https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/secured-mastercard/).
